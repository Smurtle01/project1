    <h1>HOMEPAGE</h1>
	<p>Hello, my name is Alden DeHaan, and this is my first HTML project! I originally started my undergraduate career studying chemical engineering at Calvin University. However, my freshman year, the COVID pandemic began.</p>
	<p>This caused classes to go online, and in the whole jumble of it all, I ended up not doing so great, and decided it was best to drop out for the forseeable future. Once the COVID pandemic mostly ended I restarted my studies at</p>
	<p>at the College of Dupage. This time though, I started studying for my cybersecurity degree. I spent two years at the College of Dupage before getting my associates in cybersecurity and defense, and am now studying at IIT </p>
	<p>for a bachelors degree in applied cybersecurity.</p>
